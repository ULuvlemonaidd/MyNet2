# MyNet2
mynet - Advanced Layer 4 & Layer 7 DDoS Simulation Tool

mynet is a command-line demonstration tool designed to simulate Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks at both the Transport Layer (Layer 4) and the Application Layer (Layer 7).

Originally created as a lightweight Layer 4 stress-testing utility, mynet has now expanded with a brand new, more powerful Layer 7 attack menu and upgraded Layer 4 methods (including cURL support). These additions make it a versatile tool for testing server resilience in a controlled, educational environment.

‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer
This tool is intended strictly for educational purposes and authorized testing only.
Do not use mynet on any network, server, or system you do not own or have explicit written permission to test.
Misuse can result in legal consequences. Always comply with applicable laws and terms of service.
